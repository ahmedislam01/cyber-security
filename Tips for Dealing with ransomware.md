# Tips and Tactics for Dealing With Ransomware:
## Use antivirus software at all times:
* Make sure it’s set up to automatically scan your emails and removable media (e.g., flash drives) for ransomware and other malware.
## Keep all computers fully patched with security updates.
## Use security products or services that block access to known ransomware sites on the internet.
## Configure operating systems or use third-party software to allow 
* only authorized applications to run on computers, thus preventing ransomware from working.
## Restrict or prohibit use of personally
* owned devices on your organization’s networks and for telework or remote access unless you’re taking extra steps to assure security.
## Use standard user accounts:
* instead of accounts with administrative privileges whenever possible.
## Avoid using personal applications and websites:
* such as email, chat and social media, on work computers.
## Avoid opening files, clicking on links, etc. from unknown sources:
* without first checking them for suspicious content. For example, you can run an antivirus scan on a file, and inspect links carefully.
