# Cyber Security
# Why we use Cyber Security?
* Cybersecurity is used to protect computers, networks, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. 
* This includes protection against various types of cyber attacks such as hacking, phishing, malware, ransomware, and others. 

# What is Cyber Security?
* Cybersecurity refers to the practices and technologies aimed at protecting computer systems, networks and data from theft, damage and unauthorized access. Cyber Security is the protection of internet connected systems, including Hardwares, Softwares and data form cyberattack.
# Cyber Threats
# Malware and its types?
* Malware is a type of software designed to cause harm to a computer system, network, or user. The term malware is a contraction of "malicious software." There are several types of malware, including:

* Virus: A type of malware that replicates itself and spreads to other computers.
* Trojan: A type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software but is actually malicious.
* Worm: A type of malware that spreads from computer to computer through network connections.
* Spyware: A type of malware that tracks a user's online activities and collects personal information.
* Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
* Adware: A type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on a users computer.

# Phishing attack?
* Phishing is a type of online fraud that uses emails, websites, or other communication channels to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details.
### There are several types of phishing, including:
* Email phishing: A type of phishing that uses emails to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
* Smishing: A type of phishing that uses text messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
* Vishing: A type of phishing that uses voice calls, often made using VoIP, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
* Spear phishing: A type of phishing that targets specific individuals or organizations, using personalized tactics to increase the chances of success.
* Website phishing: A type of phishing that uses fake websites that mimic legitimate ones to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
### Phishing can be prevented by being cautious when receiving unsolicited emails or messages, verifying the identity of the sender, and not clicking on suspicious links. Additionally, using anti-phishing software or browser extensions can help to protect against phishing attacks.

# Password Attacking?
* Password attacking is a type of cyber attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or online account by cracking or guessing passwords. 
### There are several methods used in password attacks including:
* Brute force attack: An attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
* Dictionary attack: An attacker uses a list of commonly used passwords to try and guess the correct password.
* Rainbow table attack: An attacker uses pre-computed tables of hashes to crack passwords more efficiently than a brute force attack.
* Social engineering attack: An attacker uses trickery or deception to obtain someone's password, such as through phishing or pretexting.
* Keylogging: An attacker uses software to record every keystroke made on a computer to steal passwords.
### Password attacks can be prevented by using strong, unique passwords, regularly changing passwords, and using two-factor authentication where possible. Additionally, using a password manager can help to generate and store secure passwords.

# DDOS Attack?
* A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber attack that aims to make a computer system or network unavailable by overwhelming it with a large amount of traffic from multiple sources. 
### There are several types of DDoS attacks, including:
* Volumetric attack: This type of attack involves overwhelming the target system with a large amount of traffic, such as a flooding the network with junk data packets.
* Protocol attack: This type of attack exploits weaknesses in the underlying communication protocols used by the target system, such as by sending a large number of malformed packets.
* Application attack: This type of attack targets specific applications running on the target system, such as by sending a large number of requests to a web server.
* Amplification attack: This type of attack leverages the amplification effect of vulnerable servers to generate a large amount of traffic to the target system.
* TCP SYN flood: This type of attack involves sending a large number of connection requests to the target system, overloading its resources and making it unavailable.
### Preventing DDoS attacks involves using a combination of techniques, such as using firewalls, intrusion detection systems, traffic filtering systems, and cloud-based DDoS protection services.

# Man in the Middle Attack (MITM)?
* A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties, without either of them being aware of the interference. 
### There are several types of MITM attacks, including:
* ARP spoofing: This type of attack involves altering the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache of a device to redirect traffic to the attacker.
* DNS spoofing: This type of attack involves altering the mapping of domain names to IP addresses to redirect traffic to a malicious website.
* SSL/TLS spoofing: This type of attack involves using a fake SSL/TLS certificate to create a false secure connection and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials.
* Wireless network attack: This type of attack involves intercepting the communication between a wireless client and the access point to steal sensitive information or redirect traffic.
* Router attack: This type of attack involves compromising a router to redirect traffic, eavesdrop on communication, or steal sensitive information.
### To prevent MITM attack it is important to use encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS, to secure communication verify the authenticity of websites and network devices and use secure protocols such as HTTPS.

# Drive-By Download Attack?
* A Drive-by Download attack is a type of cyber attack in which a user's computer is infected with malware without their knowledge or consent. This can happen when the user visits a compromised website or clicks on a malicious link, which then downloads and installs malware onto their device.
### There are several types of Drive-by Download attacks, including:
* Exploit kit attack: This type of attack leverages vulnerabilities in software applications, such as web browsers, to install malware onto the user's device.
* Malicious redirect attack: This type of attack redirects the user to a different website, which then downloads and installs malware onto the user's device.
* Ad-based attack: This type of attack involves displaying a malicious advertisement that downloads and installs malware onto the user's device.
* Watering hole attack: This type of attack involves compromising a website that the target user is known to visit and then downloading and installing malware onto the user's device when they visit the website.
### To prevent Drive-by Download attacks, it is important to keep software applications such as web browsers and plugins up-to-date, avoid clicking on suspicious links and use anti-malware software and a firewall to protect the device.

# Rogue Software Attack?
* The goal of a rogue software attack is to install malicious software onto a user's device and steal sensitive information, spread malware to other devices, or compromise the user's device for other malicious purposes.
### There are several types of rogue software attacks, including:
* Rogue security software: This type of attack involves using fake anti-virus software to trick users into downloading and installing malware onto their device.
* Fake updates: This type of attack involves tricking users into downloading and installing fake updates for software applications, which then install malware onto the user's device.

* Malicious redirects: This type of attack involves redirecting users to a malicious website, which then downloads and installs malware onto their device.
* Fake ads: This type of attack involves creating fake advertisements that look like legitimate advertisements, but contain malicious code that can download and install malware onto the user's device.
* Watering hole attacks: This type of attack involves compromising a website that the target user is known to visit and then displaying a malicious advertisement that downloads and installs malware onto the user's device.

### To prevent malvertising attacks, it is important to keep software applications, such as web browsers and plugins, up-to-date, avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements, and use anti-malware software and a firewall to protect the device.


# The CIA Traids
* The CIA triad is used as a framework for evaluating information security risks and for developing and implementing security controls to protect sensitive information.
## The three elements of the CIA triad are:
### Confidentiality:
* Ensuring that information is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.
### Integrity: 
* Ensuring that information is accurate and cannot be modified by unauthorized parties.
### Availability: 
* Ensuring that authorized users have access to the information when they need it.

# Vulnerability:
* Vulnerability refers to a weakness in a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or to compromise sensitive information. Vulnerabilities can arise from a number of sources, including software bugs, poor design or configuration, and human error.

# Threats:
* Threats refer to the various methods that an attacker may use to exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm or compromise sensitive information.

# Risk
* Risks are the potential consequences of a vulnerability being exploited by a threat. Risks can include loss of sensitive information


#NIST Framework
* NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data.
##Why we need Framework for CyberSecyrity?
* It helps the organization to manage understand and reduce CyberSecurity risks.
## Why do I need NIST?
* The main function of NIST is to create best practices (also known as standards) for organizations and government agencies to follow. These security standards are developed to improve the security posture of government agencies and private companies dealing with government data.

## Types of framework:
# PCIDDS:
* Stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is designed to secure credit cards,debit cards and cash card transaction.
# ISO 2700:
* International Organization of Standardization. It is designed to managing and secure information security management system.
# CIS:
* CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems and data against cyberattacks. Used by thousands of businesses, they offer prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration.
# NIST:
* It is most popular Framework used now a days.Naional Institute Of Standard And Technology. 
* It is designed to make organization secure. These organization may be include national security centers, economic organizations.
